Some of the most prominent projects that preceded Bitcoin include: Digicash, b-money, Hashcash, and e-gold.\n\nBitcoin is often associated with Austrian economic theories, anarcho-capitalist principles, and general libertarian politicking by virtue of the exclusive developer community to whom Nakamoto first released their white paper, certain protocol design characteristics, and the central tendency of political affiliations among early Bitcoin investors. Nakamoto included a now-famous The Times headline in Bitcoin\u2019s genesis block coinbase to prove the network\u2019s fair launch.

blockchain computing platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications.", "background": "Ethereum was conceived by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 after what he perceived as limitations in the functionality of Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language, namely the lack of Turing completeness. The white paper was published later that year describing a distributed computing platform for executing smart contracts and building decentralized applications (dApps). \n\nIn 2014, a crowdsale of tokens was overseen by The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum\u2019s research, core protocol development, and ecosystem growth. The foundation has been a primary funding organization operating through grants for teams building on Ethereum. \n\nThe network officially launched in 2015 with the first live release known as Frontier. Shortly after, the first Initial Coin Offering was conducted by Augur. This ability to create a token for a decentralized network proved to be a key use case for Ethereum as thousands of tokens have since been created raising billions of dollars. \n\nIn July 2017, a bug was exploited in a decentralized venture fund known as The DAO which allowed the attacker to siphon 3.6 million ETH. This led to a contentious hard fork to reverse the transactions causing a permanent split in the network. The legacy chain that did not reverse the transactions is known as Ethereum Classic (ETC). \n\nScalability was long known to be an issue for Ethereum if it was going to execute on its vision, and this was highlighted after a dApp called Cryptokitties became popular and led to the network becoming congested. This resulted in longer transaction times and higher fees which many viewed as an existential threat. In order to solve this problem, key architectural changes had to be made which are now on the roadmap as a shift to ETH 2.0 is on the way.", "technology": null, "category": "Infrastructure", "sector": "Smart Contract Platforms", "tag": null, "sfarScore": 2, "token_distribution": {"sale_start": "2014-07-20", "sale_end": "2014-09-02", "initial_distribution": 72000000, "current_supply": 101590235, "max_supply": 146976613, "description": "Ethereum\u2019s original token distribution event, managed by the Ethereum Foundation, sold roughly 60 million ethers (80% of the initial 72 million ether supply) to the public.

Of the ether sent to the Foundation, 3 million were allocated to a long-term endowment, 6 million were distributed among 85 developers who contributed prior to the crowdsale, and 3 million were designed as a \u201cdeveloper purchase program\u201d that gave Ethereum developers the rights to purchase ether at crowdsale prices.\n\nNew ether are generated via block rewards, initially set a 5 ether per block. Ethereum has hard-forked three times to reduce block reward issuance. Byzantium, the first fork, reduced block rewards from 5 to 3 ether. Constantinople and St. Petersburg, two later forks, reduce block rewards from 3 to 2 ether.\n\nOf the total issued ether supply, Messari considers as illiquid the 500,000+ ether locked in Ethereum\u2019s Parity multi-sig wallet bug.\n"}, "token_details": {"usage": "Payments", "type": "Native", "sales_rounds": [{"roundName": "Public Token Sale", "startDate": "2014-07-22", "endDate": "2014-09-02", "pricePerUnit": 0.0005, "unit": "BTC", "amountCollected": 31529, "restriction": null}], "block_reward": 2, "targeted_block_time_in_sec": 15, "on_chain_governance_structure": "No On-Chain Governance", "is_treasury_decentralized": false, "launch_style": "Crowdsale", "initial_supply": 72003680.24, "percentage_allocated_to_investors_from_initial_supply": 83.47, "percentage_allocated_to_premined_or_airdrops_from_initial_supply": null, "percentage_allocated_to_organizations_or_founders_supply": 16.53, "mining_algorithm": "Ethash", "next_halving_date": null, "genesis_block_date": "2015-07-30", "is_victim_of_51_percent_attack": false, "emission_type_general": "Inflationary", "emission_type_precise": "Fixed Issuance", "is_capped_supply": false, "max_supply": 146976613}, "organizations": [{"name": "Ethereum Foundation", "founded_date": "2014-01-01", "governance": null, "legal_structure": "Foundation", "jurisdiction": "Switzerland", "org_charter": null, "description": "Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.", "people_count_estimate": null}], "people": {"founding_team": null, "contributors": [{"first_name": "Vitalik", "last_name": "Buterin", "description": "Vitalik is the creator of Ethereum.

Given their substantial volume and high fees charged by incumbent payment processors dominating the market at the time.\n\nEntering the cross border payments market led to regulatory scrutiny with FinCEN fining Ripple Inc for violating the bank secrecy act in 2015. As part of the remedial plan related to the fine, Ripple Inc agreed to enhance the anti-money laundering capabilities of the XRP protocol and stricter permissioning requirements were added for additional participants to join the network.\n\nTo further enhance the credibility of XRP as a partner for traditional financial institutions, Ripple Inc obtained a virtual currency license from the State of New York in 2016. \n\nThe upside of these enhancements and engagement with regulators was it gave XRP the capability to more deeply integrate with the traditional financial system. Evolving its functionality and allowing it to act as a settlement system with no central operator. SBI Holdings set up a subsidiary, SBI Ripple Asia, dedicated to bringing this vision to Japan. Were over 60 banks controlling over 80% of banking assets in Japan have joined the consortium using the XRP protocol for this purpose.\n\nRecent Ripple Inc. efforts have focused on expanding XRPs capabilities for functionally specific purposes. \n\nxCurrent is a messaging solution enabling banks to initiate and confirm cross-border payments with each other.\nxRapid \u2013 Seeks to lower the capital requirements needed to effectively function in developing markets.\nxVia \u2013 Enables seamless sending of global invoices.\n", "technology": "XRP's foundation is a shared public ledger used by network participants to exchange value globally. A super majority of validators is required for the network to arrive at consensus to validate transactions initiated across the network. Because of the existence of multiple validators the project should be able to survive the loss of its original sponsor, Ripple Inc, if something where to happen to it.\n\nOne of XRP\u2019s first initiatives was to build the bitcoin bridge to link Ripplenet to the Bitcoin network. The bridge allows XRP users to conduct transactions directly in bitcoin without independently acquiring them by making it possible to make payments in bitcoin directly from their XRP account using other assets such as the XRP token.\nRipple Inc, has focused on integrating user verification protocols so network participants are able to define which users they trust and how much they trust them. This has the effect of causing transactions to \u201cripple\u201d across the network. Because if two users without a direct relationship initiate a transaction across the network. It ripples outward finding a path linking the users together from their trusted relationships to complete the transaction. Similar to how hawala financing systems function off line.\n\nFor users just getting started, Ripple Inc., maintains a unique node list users can select by default representing validators with a history of reliably operating on the XRP network.\n\nCross currency transactions typically take 3 \u2013 5 seconds to process across the ledger. Once initiated, XRP\u2019s path finding algorithm identifies the quickest least expensive way to complete the transaction. Because XRP operates as a permissioned distributed ledger, once completed, transactions are irreversible. Generally, for the path finding algorithm to work optimally, a large number of market makers need to be operating on the network so sufficient liquidity is available to efficiently complete transactions.\n\nTo encourage development of a robust ecosystem around the ledger, XRP maintains a variety of APIs to help nodes and other third parties interact with it based on the REST API standard. Leading to invoicing and wallet solutions so businesses can incorporate it as a payment option for their customers.\n", "category": "Payments", "sector": "Currencies", "tag": null, "sfarScore": 4, "token_distribution": {"sale_start": null, "sale_end": null, "initial_distribution": 200000000, "current_supply": 21821174210, "max_supply": 99997634397, "description": "100 billion XRP were pre-mined prior to its launch in January 2013.

In 2014 Larsen committed 7 billion of the allocation to a charitable foundation.\n\n9.5% (9.5 billion) allocated to Jed McCaleb. Who subsequently donated 2 billion of his allocation to a donor advised fund. In 2014 McCaleb negotiated an exit agreement from the project dictating his remaining allocation would be held in a custodial account and released to him on a monthly schedule. A daily cap on the amount he can sell of the tokens released is included in the agreement.\n\n1% (1 billion) allocated to Arthur Britto.\n\nOf the 80% (80 billion) allocation pledged to support Ripplenet. 55% (55 billion) was placed in escrow by Ripple Inc. in late 2017. To alleviate concerns a mass amount of XRP could hit the market all at one with substantial negative price impact.\n\n1 billion is released monthly to support Ripple\u2019s ongoing operation of Ripplenet. Any unused funds are returned to escrow at the end of the month. So if 500 million is spent the remaining 500 million is returned to escrow and reintegrated into the monthly release schedule. \n"}, "token_details": {"usage": "Payments", "type": "Native", "sales_rounds": null, "block_reward": null, "targeted_block_time_in_sec": null, "on_chain_governance_structure": "No On-Chain Governance", "is_treasury_decentralized": false, "launch_style": "Centralized Distribution", "initial_supply": 100000000000, "percentage_allocated_to_investors_from_initial_supply": null, "percentage_allocated_to_premined_or_airdrops_from_initial_supply": 0.2, "percentage_allocated_to_organizations_or_founders_supply": 99.8, "mining_algorithm": "n/a", "next_halving_date": null, "genesis_block_date": null, "is_victim_of_51_percent_attack": false, "emission_type_general": "Deflationary", "emission_type_precise": "Programmatic burn", "is_capped_supply": true, "max_supply": 99997634397}, "organizations": [{"name": "Ripple", "founded_date": "2012-09-01", "governance": null, "legal_structure": "Corporation", "jurisdiction": "San Francisco", "org_charter": null, "description": "Ripple Labs (a.k.a., \"Ripple\") is a digital asset technology company that develops the Ripple payment protocol.

The project was created as an attempt to solve two major issues with existing cryptoassets; merchants and businesses are hesitant to transact in assets that have high volatility and existing banking infrastructure makes it difficult to convert between fiat currencies and cryptoassets. Some of these issues stem from the relatively low capitalization of cryptoassets, inefficiencies in the modern banking system, and stringent or undefined regulations related to know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering laws. \n\nTo address these perceived issues Tether created a cryptographic token that claims to be backed fully by deposits of U.S. dollars held at banks. Tether utilizes the Bitcoin blockchain, through the Omni layer, to issue and track tokens. While the tokens themselves operate in a decentralized network, Hong Kong based Tether Ltd controls the process of creating or redeeming tokens. This report focuses on USDT, the tokens tied to U.S. dollar deposits, though there is a small amount of Euro tokens in circulation. \n\nExchanges have been the primary users of USDT as an alternative to fiat currencies, reducing or eliminating the need to maintain outside banking relationships. Notable exchanges that utilize the token include Bitfinex, Bittrex, Binance, Kraken, Huobi, Poloniex, Liquid.io, Gate.io, and OKEx. Tether shares many common executives with Hong Kong based Bitfinex.", "technology": "Tether relies on a proof-of-reserves system to ensure that bank deposits match circulating tokens. This requires a third-party to audit Tether\u2019s bank accounts on a regular basis to show that U.S. dollar reserves are held in an amount equal to outstanding tokens.\n\nThe proof-of-reserves system has proven controversial for Tether after a series of delayed audits and unclear banking relationships. On April 22, 2017, Tether announced that they were unable to process wire transfers through their existing banks and followed up with an announcement on Sept. 5, 2017, that they had found a new bank to use in the short-term.1 On Sept. 28, 2017, Tether released a preliminary review signed off on by third-party accounting firm Friedman LLP. It is important to note this was\nnot a full audit to verify funds but simply included Freidman viewing screen-shots or printouts of bank account details. Since the review, the amount of outstanding Tether has grown to $2.45 billion with no official audit to confirm that reserves are held as\npromised.  \n\nIn Jan. 2018 the project announced that it had ended its relationship with Friedman LLP who was conducting an audit on Tether's balance sheet. Tether later released an update in June 2018, from law firm Freeh, Sporkin, and Sullivan LLP. that verified the bank account holdings of Tether's USD reserves as of June 1, 2018. This again was not a full audit of these balances but a point in time verification of funds.\n\nUSDT tokens are issued via the Omni Layer protocol, which was previously known as Mastercoin. Omni is a consensus network that supports various applications such as a decentralized exchange, securities transcriptions, on-chain data feeds, savings\naddresses and self-stabilizing currencies. \n\nThe system takes advantage of Bitcoin\u2019s OP_RETURN scheme, which allows users to include 40 bytes of arbitrary data in the scriptSig field of a transaction. The OP_RETURN schematic designates a \u201cprunable\u201d output which miners can recognize as zero-valued and discard from their unspent transaction output (UTXO) base. Meanwhile, the extra data is still appended to the blockchain. \n\nThis system provides an effective way to store information with the security guarantees of an immutable distributed ledger, while reducing bloat on the blockchain. Users can embed specific information into the hex segment of the ScriptPubKey field in a Bitcoin transaction. The Omni protocol interprets this information where it is used to initiate transactions. By leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain the Omni protocol is able to take advantage of the strength of the underlying blockchain without needed to create a new consensus system.\n\nTether uses an IOU issuance model where users have a claim to some form of asset that exists outside the blockchain, in this case, U.S. dollars. Each USDT represents a claim for $1.00 held in the bank reserves which users can redeem at any time.\n\nIn order to prove that reserves exist and the system is solvent, the project relies on a proof-of-reserves system. The system is fully collateralized when the number of USDT in circulation matches the value of the funds held in accounts operated by Tether\nLimited. Both of these, in theory, are trivial to audit. Outstanding USDT balances can be viewed on any Omni Layer or Bitcoin block explorers.

If a user wishes to redeem USDT they can send tokens to an address controlled by Tether Ltd. who will destroy the tokens and transfer fiat currency to the user's bank\naccount. \n\nIssuance of USDT grew dramatically in 2017.

Who view security as the factor that should be optimized for with the whitepaper reflecting a rough blueprint or important historical document.  \n\nThe execution of the fork on August 1, 2017 led to confusion amongst investors who tried to claim, sell, or spend their BCH due to inconsistent exchange tickers, branding misinformation, and incorrect address use. Bitcoin Cash users lose coins when attempting to send BTC to a BCH address and vice versa. Recognizing this issue Bitcoin Cash migrated to a new address format in January 2018 to improve usability and reduce the chances of errors leading to lost coins.\n\nBitcoin Cash expects to ultimately become more decentralized and widely used than Bitcoin by scaling transaction throughput faster via a higher paced development cycle for technological improvements significantly reducing transactions costs versus Bitcoin.\n\nIt is expected due to the technology requirements needed to scale the network. Individual users will not be able to run nodes easily via PCs like they can for the Bitcoin network making it potentially less censorship resistant than the Bitcoin blockchain.\n", "technology": null, "category": "Payments", "sector": "Currencies", "tag": null, "sfarScore": null, "token_distribution": {"sale_start": "2017-08-01", "sale_end": "2017-08-01", "initial_distribution": 16000000, "current_supply": 17430000, "max_supply": 21000000, "description": "A chain hard fork initially distributes new coins to current private key holders by taking a \"snapshot\" of exiting UTXO sets and crediting an equal balance of coins on the new chain to all addresses on the parent chain.

that is designed to focus on transaction speed, scalability and throughput", "background": "EOS was published by software publisher Block.one and development is led by CTO Dan Larimer, who founded Steemit and BitShares. The project competes with other popular smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, NEO and Cardano. EOS tries to differentiate itself by providing transaction throughput capable of handling thousands of transactions per second without having to pay direct fees, improved usability for all parties involved, and governance for business and chain maintenance. \n\nEOS makes use of on-chain governance whereby token holders can vote for the block producers (BPs) as well as various upgrades to the protocol, monetary policy, or constitution. This constitution includes general rules governing the behavior of the protocol, and every transaction sent must include a hash of it. The goal is to define community values that are not enforceable or incentivized easily. However, the rules are not enforceable at the protocol level but rather act as a terms-of-service agreement which users must agree to. Dispute settlement is left to the EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF), which is comprised of independent professionals who can deliver binding rulings which BPs then execute. \n\nEcosystem funds play an important role in the growth and adoption of EOS. Their mandate is to make strategic investments that increase the value of the projects and tokens to ensure the necessary infrastructure is built and proper incentivization exists to attract developers to build on the platform. The most prominent is a $325 million fund ran by Mike Novogratz and Galaxy Digital LP.", "technology": "EOS's DPoS is based on 21 BP's voted on by token holders where votes are weighted by the number of tokens held and holders can opt to delegate their votes to another holder on their behalf. Anyone can participate in the block production so long as they can receive enough votes, and the vote is ongoing so at any time BP's can be replaced by another entity voters believe will act in their best interests. \n\nBlocks are produced every 0.5 seconds and one BP produces a block at any given time. Once 15 BP\u2019s sign a block, it is deemed irreversible. Under normal conditions, DPoS does not experience forks because rather than competing, BPs cooperate to produce blocks. In the event of a fork, consensus will automatically switch to the longest chain because the rate at which blocks are added to a fork is directly correlated to the percentage of BP\u2019s that share the same consensus.\n\nEOS utilizes a no direct fee model where tokens give holders access to their pro-rata share of network resources. That being said any operation needing storage or to create an account requires RAM to be purchased. This differs from bandwidth and CPU, which token holders receive by staking and receiving proportional amount of the network resources.\n\nEOS uses the WebAssembly Virtual Machine (WASM) which offers high speed and performance as well as a multitude of programming languages such as C++ or Rust giving developers access to existing optimization and debugging tools. \n\nAdditionally, EOS implements human readable names and account recovery solutions at the protocol level. Recovery is made possible with the designation of a recovery party who can reset the owners keys with their approval. Unlike traditional multi-signature applications, the recovery partner has no control over the account other than helping the owner reset their keys.", "category": "Infrastructure", "sector": "Smart Contract Platforms", "tag": null, "sfarScore": null, "token_distribution": {"sale_start": "2017-06-26", "sale_end": "2018-07-01", "initial_distribution": 1000000000, "current_supply": 906245118, "max_supply": 0, "description": "EOS began their sale June 26th, 2017 selling 200 million tokens over a five day period, raising a total of $172 million.

Bitcoin client", "overview": "Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision is a fork of Bitcoin Cash that aims for strict adherence to Satoshi Nakamoto's original design of the Bitcoin protocol.", "background": "Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision (BSV) is the result of a perennial controversy within certain cryptocurrency circles about what Satoshi Nakamoto's vision for Bitcoin was and if Bitcoin is or should strictly adhere to their vision. BSV's ethos is to \"restore what was the original Bitcoin protocol.\"\n\nBSV is not alone in their pursuit to honor Nakamoto's vision, and they, with a panoply of other projects, claim the 2008 Nakamoto white paper as their project's white paper. BSV's website also elaborates on the differentiation between existing attempts to preserve Nakmoto's vision and BSV's goals. \n\nThe decision to hard fork from the Bcash chain was a result of a dispute over implementing the graphene algorithm into Bcash in the summer of 2018. Additional points of contention related to script enhancements enabling deployment of smart contracts on Bcash once the hard fork went into effect on November 15, 2018.\n\nCommunity members dissatisfied with the decision to implement these updates because they felt they violated Satoshi\u2019s orginial vision for Bitcoin, started the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision project in response. To continue their pursuit of what they believed to be Nakamoto's original vision.\n\nSupport from Coingeek\u2019s mining operations reassured the Satoshi Vision team they would have adequate hash power to properly secure the BSV network post-fork.  To hopefully entice large volumes of commercial transactions to the network because of its improved scalability from the implementation of larger block sizes with the selling point of lower costs than existing invoice and receipt systems and the ability to transfer value globally with minimal fees.\n\nInitially the intent was to demonstrate the superiority of Satoshi\u2019s Vision as a feature set for Bitcoin Cash. Resulting in the most hash power used to determine consensus for the Bitcoin Cash chain. Allowing for a reorganization of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain back to its feature set prior to the hard fork with the new Bitcoin SV features included. \n \nThis was prevented from happening when the core Bitcoin Cash team added checkpoints to Bitcoin Cash\u2019s code. Checkpoints prevent the reorganization of blocks below a check pointed block. The inclusion of checkpoints finalized the split between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV permanently.\n", "technology": "At block 556759 of the Bitcoin Cash chain (previously forked from the original Bitcoin blockchain), Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision forked to create a separate chain reflecting the original Bitcoin 0.1.0 protocol focused on four characteristics, which the BSV team feels most closely mirror Satoshi's original intent for Bitcoin: stability, scalability, security, and safe instant transactions.\n \nFirst steps to restoring Satoshi's vision include support for the original Bitcoin client's script language and re-enabling all original Bitcoin opcodes, some of which are no longer used by Bitcoin (BTC). Additionally the limit of 201 opcodes per script was removed.\n\nBSV targets stability by almost immediately ossifying the codebase except for, according to the project website, \"any critical security fixes\". For scalability, BSV will support 128 MB block sizes, larger than any Bitcoin fork to date. Contending Satoshi intended the original 1 MB block size to be a temporary measure.\n\nZero-confirmation transactions are the key to BSV's safe, instant transactions goal, which should allow for rapid transaction propagation, secure confirmation, and miner-configurable fee policies. Along with a record of the event that can be stored for future confirmation of items like tax payments. \n\nTo facilitate zero-confirmation transactions users can directly connect to each other using IP addresses with secure domain identifiers to communicate. Direct connection via IP-2-IP enhances the privacy of transacting parties because the record of the transaction is public without disclosing any identity details.\n\nTo further enhance privacy Bitcoin SV is developing wallet solutions that will allow users to easily create new keys for every transaction. So their activity across the network cannot be easily aggregated and traced by third party monitors.\n\nOne of the op_codes Bitcoin SV removed allowed for the burning of coins permanently. Meaning, Bitcoin SV does not remove coins permanently, allowing them to re-enter circulation when miners act to salvage coins that have been lost from circulation.", "category": "Payments", "sector": "Currencies", "tag": null, "sfarScore": null, "token_distribution": {"sale_start": null, "sale_end": null, "initial_distribution": null, "current_supply": null, "max_supply": null, "description": "A chain hard fork initially distributes new coins to current private key holders by taking a \"snapshot\" of exiting UTXO sets and crediting an equal balance of coins on the new chain to all addresses on the parent chain.

payments network that circulates a native asset, Stellar Lumens (XLM). Stellar was launched in 2014 by Jeb McCaleb, co-founder of Ripple, to increase global access to basic financial services. The Stellar blockchain allows anyone to issue new assets in the network and exchange other assets via built-in currency exchange features. For example, a user may send dollars even though they hold euros, and Stellar automatically converts the currencies at the best available rates.\n\nThe Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) is a non-profit dedicated to supporting the growth and development of Stellar. SDF was created in collaboration with Stripe, which provided $3 million in seed funding, and is financed by Stellar Lumens. SDF has three boards: the Board of Directors, responsible for governance decisions and XLM distribution; the Architecture Board, responsible for technical initiatives; and the Expansion Board, responsible for ecosystem growth and regulatory issues.", "technology": "The Stellar blockchain consensus mechanism is called Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), an implementation of the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). The FBA is a fairly new consensus mechanism pioneered by Ripple. The SCP is the first provable safe FBA blockchain protocol.\n\nAn FBA allows nodes to choose which peers the trust based on intrinsic or extrinsic factors set by the nodes. This dynamic creates network-wide quorums as individual nodes relay and verify network activity information. FBAs rely on \u201cquorum slices\u201d to reach consensus\u2014subsets of a quorum that can convince an individual node to agree with the \u201cslice.\u201d Stellar nodes can choose their own quorum slices.\n\nTo attack the Stellar network, a reputable institution would need to control 51% or more of the network\u2019s trusted nodes. Stellar disinventivizes this by financial rewarding honest actors in the network via fees and other rewards. Stellar also adds an element of reputation and social identity by keeping network actors as known entities, which incentivizes financial institutions to maintain the trust of their peers.\n\nSome of these trusted financial institutions are called Anchors, a crucial part of the Stellar blockchain network. Anchors maintain wallets with fiat and XLM balances to allow currency exchange. Anchors control the fees they charge for network peers to use their services, and users can pick which anchor manages their exchanges.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain also supports launching native assets similar to issuing tokens on Ethereum.

privacy-focused code fork of Bytecoin", "overview": "Monero is a code fork of Bytecoin that prioritizes privacy, fungibility and untraceability.", "background": "When Monero launched, conversations around Bitcoin's on-chain privacy features caused a spree of privacy-focused projects to enter the digital asset market. Monero forked from Bitmonero 6 days after its launch. Due to some questionable token distribution practices by the Bitmonero project leads. \n\nEmerging as a privacy-focused cryptocurrency based on CryptoNote, a reference implementation for new altcoins many of which were later exposed as fraudulent projects. Monero's payment anonymity has garnered significant attention from a panoply of crypto-curious persons.\n\nMonero employs a community driven capital allocation process. Where by anybody can propose ideas which are funded when accepted via donations to the forum funding system. With funds being released when milestones are achieved. \n", "technology": "Monero runs a proof-of-work algorithm called CryptoNight, which is friendly toward CPU and GPU mining. New blocks are added to the chain on average every two minutes. Mining difficulty adjusts after each new block. To maintain friendliness to CPU and GPU miners Monero initiates hard forks every 6 months to disrupt the operations of ASIC miners. Generally, making upgrades to the protocol at the same time.\n\nMonero's privacy enhancements come from CryptoNote which masks sender identities via ring signature mixing and offers single-use keys to make transactions untraceable. Ring signatures merge a group of signers together to better preserve the anonymity of the true signer. The group is comprised of the actual signers single use key initiating the transaction and past transaction outputs from Monero\u2019s blockchain.\n\nIncluding past transaction outputs helps preserve the senders anonymity because they are theoretically indistinguishable to an outside observer as the valid transaction itself. At times, questions have arisen regarding how indistinguishable historical transactions really are since they are tied to Monero\u2019s blockchain. To alleviate these concerns the hard fork of March 9, 2019 included protocol upgrades increasing the opaqueness of historical transactions.\n\nTo verify the output of transactions Monero uses key images. Key images are posted to the Monero blockchain once a transaction is complete. Ensuring miners can verify no coins are double spent by confirming a transactions key image has not been previously used. Key images are cryptographically secured and cannot be used to identify which output created the image.\n\nTo support its ecosystem Monero has built out a fully featured wallet. Making it easy for users to set up nodes, mine, or transact across the network.\n", "category": "Payments", "sector": "Currencies", "tag": "Privacy", "sfarScore": 1, "token_distribution": {"sale_start": "2014-04-18", "sale_end": "2014-04-18", "initial_distribution": 0, "current_supply": 16600000, "max_supply": 0, "description": "Monero's real supply is infinite for all intents and purposes, a feature that enables a high level of on-chain transactional anonymity.

In 2018, the project purchased file sharing service BitTorrent in order to expand its product. Tron is a long-term project with a set of 6 phases. \n\n1. Exodus: building the free platform for peer to peer distribution, storage, and content. Exodus\u2019 goal is to provide a simple distributed file sharing built on something similar to IPFS. \n2. Odyssey: introducing financial incentives to encourage content creation. Odyssey is supposed to incentivize early adopters and foster the growth of a community consisting of content creators and consumers. Reimbursement for creation will be through a tipping scheme, instead of views and clicks - as those methods can be easily exploited through bots.\n3. Great Voyage: launching TRON-native ICO capability. Tron looks to allow content creators to offer a stake in a potential personal brand through individual ICOs or branded tokens. \n4. Apollo: enable content producers to issue personal tokens\n5. Star Trek: brings a decentralized gaming and forecasting platform.\n6. Eternity: aim for further decentralization of the gaming industry. This phase aims to bring the ability to fund-raise and monetize based on community growth. \n\nEventually, Tron\u2019s core technology will be based on the adaptation of IPFS and Ethereum\u2019s platform. In short, what Tron is trying to create is a huge mixture of what is already being done by other projects. Relatedly, Tron is criticized for plagiarism regarding its white paper. Founder Justin Sun tweeted that the translation was done by volunteers and excused it as carelessness on the part of translators.\n", "technology": "Tron relies on consensus through a delegated proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol allows approximately 1000 transactions per second and supports smart contracts written in Java, Python, and other common programming languages. A total of 27 \"super representatives\" are responsible for validating blocks on the network. Super representatives are chosen through a voting system that allows users to vote based on the tokens that they hold.\n\nTron\u2019s chain has a 3-tiered architecture: the storage layer, core layer, and application layer. The storage layer adopts a distributed protocol branched into block storage and state storage. Its underlying storage layer uses the graph database to manage data storage, which aims to manage data storage as Tron not only stores the node data but also inter-node connections. Its middle layer is composed of modules of smart contracts, account management, consensus and more. \n\nTronix (TRX) is the official name for the native Tron token. Miners earn TRX by providing data storage space to network users. Tron intends to be used as market model rather than a cloud model. Tron expects TRX tokens to act as a mediator between consumers and content creators without the need for token exchanges. It was initially an ERC20 token. On June 24th, 2018, Tron migrated from Ethereum protocol to TRON MainNet in a one-to-one swap. \n", "category": "Infrastructure", "sector": "Smart Contract Platforms", "tag": null, "sfarScore": null, "token_distribution": {"sale_start": null, "sale_end": null, "initial_distribution": null, "current_supply": null, "max_supply": null, "description": "Tronix has a total supply of 100 billion tokens.

peer-reviewed academic research, according to the team. Cardano does not have a single published white paper but is developed from a collection of academic papers. Cardano see itself as a \u201cthird generation\u201d protocol, improving on Bitcoin and Ethereum as the first and second generations, respectively. Cardano is named after an Italian Renaissance mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, and its native currency ADA is named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician sometimes referenced as the first computer programmer. \n\nCardano is backed by three entities: IOHK, The Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo. IOHK is a blockchain research and development company founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood that is contracted to work on Cardano from 2015 through 2020. The Cardano Foundation is a non-profit organization focused on core development and ecosystem growth for Cardano. Emurgo is a Japanese venture capital firm. \n\nCardano is developed in 5 phases:\n\n1. Byron: the bootstrap era where the network is only operated by designated peers and block rewards are burned\n2. Shelly: the phase for transition away from trusted nodes to public network but protocol development will still be centralized\n3. Goguen: the phase for delivering sidechain and smart contract capabilities \n4. Basho: the phase focused on settlement and computation layer performance improvements\n5. Voltaire: the phase for introducing a treasury and governance system\n", "technology": "The Cardano blockchain has two layers: a settlement layer and a computation layer. The Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) serves to settle transactions made by peers in the network with ADA, Cardano\u2019s native currency. The Cardano Computation Layer (CCL) is optimized to support smart contracts and decentralized applications. Cardano developers chose a layered protocol to increase the network\u2019s capacity for protocol changes and soft fork implementations. Cardano is developed in Haskell and Cardano smart contracts are created in Plutus, another programming language that allows for building stricter contracts.\n\nCardano uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. Ouroboros consensus aims for improved network security and modularized design. Cardano\u2019s modularization allows for network delegation, sidechains, improved light client data structures, and more.\n\nOuroboros consensus is determined by slot leaders who are elected by token holders with sufficient stake in the network. Slot leaders operate in epochs to listen for and confirm transactions to produce blocks, which are then approved by input endorsers. A Cardanoo input endorser is a second set of stakeholder that verifies transactions included in blocks. Cardano believes this design is highly scalable since the network ca increase the number of slots per epoch and run multiple epochs across the network simultaneously.", "category": "Infrastructure", "sector": "Smart Contract Platforms", "tag": null, "sfarScore": null, "token_distribution": {"sale_start": "2015-01-09", "sale_end": "2017-01-01", "initial_distribution": 25927070538, "current_supply": 25927070538, "max_supply": 45000000000, "description": "Cardano caps the supply of ADA at 45 billion. The current ADA supply is roughly 31 billion, which leaves a remaining 14 billion for network incentives. Cardano incentives compensate for the network\u2019s decrease in monetary expansion. Incentives increase as network use increases.\n\nCardano distributed vouchers for 25.9 million ADA in a public token sale from September 2015 to January 2017. Participants could redeem the vouchers for actual ADA through Cardano\u2019s native Daedalus wallet. The three entities supporting Cardano\u2019s development received 5.2 billion ADA (11.6% of total supply) following the mining of Cardano\u2019s genesis block.

The part allocated to Nodes Operators (35%\u00b0 will most likely be released when Mainnet Launch. Since no information can be found on the expected timing of Mainnet Launch we've displayed this supply as liquid from Q1 2020. We will update the supply curve once we get more detailed information on vesting schedules and distribution processes. \n"}, "token_details": {"usage": "Work", "type": "ERC-20", "sales_rounds":

technology for the internet-of-things (IoT) space where small connected devices regularly share data. Because these devices are generally specialized to be low power and perform only specific functions IOTA does not use a traditional consensus mechanism like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake nor does it use a blockchain structure. The goal of the project is to allow these devices to conduct micropayment transactions between themselves and potentially to securely transfer data. \n\nAt the core of the project is what is referred to as the 'Tangle,' a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that acts as the public ledger system. The team believes that this structure will allow for feeless payments, lower compute cost, and the ability to connect to billions of devices. The efficiency of this system also grows as the number of participants increases as transactions will be processed at a faster rate. One of the project's more recent releases was a data marketplace that allows for storing and selling data streams while masking the source of the data.", "technology": "IOTA relies on a DAG system to conduct transactions and exchange data. There is no network-wide consensus but instead local approvals between peers. In order to conduct a transaction on the network users must first verify two pending transactions on the network. Compared to other consensus mechanisms this can lead to faster transactions and lower compute cost for verification. Because IOTA uses a unique network structure and implemented its own custom-built cryptographic functions concerns have been raised around the security of the network.

is a multi-purpose blockchain which aims to combine a self-amending protocol and on-chain governance to manage future changes and implementations to the network.", "background": "Tezos was first proposed in a position paper released in Aug. 2014 with more specifics announced in a whitepaper released in Sept. 2014. The network is designed with a focus on allowing token holders to vote for proposed changes to functionality in order to avoid forking the network. In 2015 the founders, Kathleen and Arthur Breitman established a company called Dynamic Ledger Solutions which was responsible for writing the initial code for Tezos. At the core of this codebase is a system to formalize proposing, voting for, and implementing changes to the functionality of the network. Once a proposal has been made holders of Tezos (XTZ) tokens are able to vote with a weighting of one vote per token. \n\nConsensus is determined using a version of a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) system where stakers, called bakers within the network, can lock up their tokens in exchange for the ability to validate blocks. In Tezo's more liquid DPoS system users are able to \"delegate\" tokens to bakers without transferring ownership. Rewards for validating blocks are distributed to bakers in the form of new XTZ tokens with a proportional amount of the reward distributed to wallets that have delegated tokens to the baker. This enables smaller token holders to participate in the validation (and reward) process if they hold less than the required amount to become a full baker.\n\nUsing the original source code which was released in 2016 Tezos launched an alphanet in Feb. 2017 prior to their July token sale. While the network was originally planned for a late 2017 launch the betanet did not go live until June 2018 due to disagreements within the foundation which delayed the release of funds to developers.[1] Following a successful betanet launch the mainnet went live in Sept. 2018. [2]\n\n", "technology": "Tezos is a multi-purpose blockchain platform that integrates features like smart contracts, on-chain governance, and the ability to conduct formal verification. The developers made a unique choice to use OCaml as the programming language arguing that it offers better security features and is a more powerful interface compared to other options like C++. OCaml also allows developers to check operations using formal verification which can detect potential bugs or errors in the code. \n\nTo allow for future changes to the network Tezos is divided into network, transaction, and consensus protocols. The transaction and consensus protocols operate separately and plug into a generic network shell. This shell maintains the current state of the blockchain and allows the network to conduct internal checks on the protocols allowing them to validate their own replacements. Proposed changes can be made by anyone and are decided on by a vote from token holders. Proposals can include a payment to be made by the developer proposing a change which the team believes will incentive more impactful development on the platform.\n\nTezos uses a DPoS system that differs slightly from established models in that block producers are not selected by token holders and anyone can participate as a baker (validator) if they hold a specified amount of tokens. Token holders that do not meet the minimum threshold can delegate their tokens to a baker without needing to relinquish control of their tokens. Using this model the team believes they can increase participation from token holders by reducing frictions and allowing anyone to recieve newly released XTZ to maintain the relative value of their holdings.", "category": "Infrastructure", "sector": "Smart Contract Platforms", "tag": null, "sfarScore": 3.75, "token_distribution": {"sale_start": null, "sale_end": null, "initial_distribution": null, "current_supply": null, "max_supply": null, "description": "Tezos conducted an ICO from June 28, 2017 to July 13, 2017, in which 65,681 BTC and 361,122 ETH were raised.

DASH is becoming one of the go-to options for payments in high inflation, weak fiat currency countries, most notably Venezuela.\n\nDASH believes that instant transaction confirmations are required to be successful as a payment based cryptocurrency. To achieve this the block times are 2.6 minutes (unlike every 10 minutes for Bitcoin). Block sizes are currently 2MB and on-chain scaling will allow DASH to go up to 400MB.\n\n\nDash is a Proof of Work blockchain, but in addition to miners it also employs a network of masternodes to increase participation and add functionality to the ecosystem. Masternodes offer DASH users the option to send fast and/or more private transactions for a fee. Masternode operators must stake 1000 DASH, for which they receive a dividend of approximately 8% per year.

X11 provides 11 hashes making it one of the safer cryptographic hashes used in the cryptocurrency market. Unlike Bitcoin, who restricts supply with its halving of the block reward every 4 years, DASH reduces its block reward 7.14% every year.\n\nPrivateSend improves DASH fungibility through a mixing process. Wallets will break the desired amount of DASH down into common denominations, and send a special request to the masternode network. A masternode receiving one of the standard denominations will put out a request for two more of the same, and then generate a transaction that outputs the mixed coins to the addresses requested. This process can be repeated up to eight times per PrivateSend transaction.\n\nInstantSend enables fast transaction times by allowing the masternode network to lock funds in advance of the next block. When a masternode receives an InstantSend transaction, it broadcasts the request to the masternode network. If the network votes that the transaction is valid, the funds are locked and can no longer be spent by the sender. Both parties can now trust that the transaction will be completed without having to wait for the next block.\n\nDash employs the X11 hash algorithm for Proof of Work. This was originally intended to prevent ASICs from mining the chain, however, X11 capable ASICs are now on the market. X11 is a chained sequence of 11 common hash functions, and in theory, will reduce the potential harm to the network if any one of these is broken. Dash uses the open source algorithm Dark Gravity Well to adjust the difficulty every block. Both Dark Gravity Well and X11 were developed by Evan Duffield.", "category": "Payments", "sector": "Currencies", "tag": "Privacy", "sfarScore": null, "token_distribution": {"sale_start": null, "sale_end": null, "initial_distribution": null, "current_supply": null, "max_supply": null, "description": "Dash's uses a block reward system is used to incentivize miners, masternodes, and protocol development. 45% of the block reward goes to the miner who finds the next valid block, 45% goes to the masternode network, and 10% is reserved in a pool for future protocol development. During each month, proposals are submitted to the network for voting. Masternodes will vote on the proposals, and at the end of the month successful ones will receive the requested payout from the pooled funds. Masternodes also receive payments from the network for PrivateSend and InstantSend transactions.\n\nDash experienced a technical issue in the earliest days of network functionality, which has created some controversy around the project's token distribution. A bug in the mining difficulty adjustment algorithm led to the issuance of 2 million DASH, more than 10% of all future tokens, in the first 48 hours of the network when few people were

network between existing chains.", "background": "Cosmos aims to combine the utility of open-source software, decentralized value-transfer networks, and time-stamped block chain data storage to accelerate the scaling, adoption, and use-case experimentation of these protocols. It views some key obstacles to these goals as status quo inefficiency, limited performance, and ad hoc governance styles. To correct these concerns, Cosmos was created as a decentralized network of independent, scalable, and interoperable blockchains, creating the foundation for a new token economy. \n\nThe ideal solution, according to Cosmos, is to build a tool for interacting with multiple parallel blockchains such that the relative, unique value of a given chain's features are exploitable on any other chain. In essence, a layer network connecting existing chains and sync activity and growth in the blockchain space. \n\nThe Cosmos SDK is a developer-friendly, modular framework, each powered by a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm such as Tendermint Core, allowing developers to fully customize their decentralized applications and focus on business logic.", "technology": "Cosmos SDK: The Cosmos SDK is a user-friendly, modular framework that allow developers to quickly and easily build a custom blockchain application, powered by Tendermint Core\u2019s BFT Proof of Stake protocol. \n\nTendermint Core: Tendermint Core is a PBFT (practical byzantine fault tolerant) consensus protocol that prioritizes safety over liveliness. Tendermint Core\u2019s application interface, ABCI allows transactions to be processed in any language \n\nIBC: The Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) is a standard protocol that enables two chains with finality to transfer tokens and data in a decentralized way. It functions in a similar way the TCP/IP does for the internet. This is the mechanism that enables communication and crypto-asset transfers across a network of siloed blockchains to securely interoperate. \n\nEthermint: Ethermint is a Cosmos SDK application that runs the EVM as a module and is fully  compatible with the Web3 RPC interface. It supports Ethereum smart contracts, allowing Ethereum developers to easily port their dApp over into the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\n\nCosmos Wallet: Voyager is an easy-to-use wallet interface designed to enable atom holders to perform common transactions through a modern GUI: transfer coins, stake, and participate in governance on Cosmos SDK chains. \n\nPeggy: Peggy is a type of IBC designed for communicating to legacy chains (that aren't natively IBC compatible) such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and acts as a bridge to the Cosmos ecosystem.", "category": "Infrastructure", "sector": "Interoperability", "tag": null, "sfarScore": null, "token_distribution": {"sale_start": null, "sale_end": null, "initial_distribution": null, "current_supply": null, "max_supply": null, "description": "The Interchain Foundation defined 4 categories of contributions to the development and launch of the Cosmos Network: Private Contributors, Public Contributors, All in Bits Inc (AiB), and the Interchain Foundation (ICF).\n\nThe strategic and early contributors contributed an amount of USD 1,329,472.33\nat a discount from the public fundraiser's USD/ATOM rate (discounts ranged from 15-25%), prior to the public fundraiser. They received 16,856,718.97 ATOMs. The seed contributors contributed an amount of USD 300,000. They received 11,809,947.91 ATOMs.\n\nPublic contributors consisted of public members of the Tendermint and Cosmos community that participated in the fundraiser on April 6th, 2017. A total amount of 16,029,305.06 USD was contributed by 864 addresses, at a rate of USD 0.10/ATOM.\n\nAiB received 10% of the total genesis ATOM allocation for developing the open-source IP that underlies the Cosmos Network. This equals a total of 23,619,895.81 ATOMs. AiBs ATOMs are split into two sets, each subject to a different form of vesting. The first set consists of 1,777,707 ATOMs allocated to 44 addresses owned by AiB founders, contractors, and employees. These atoms are non-transferable for 12 months but can be used for staking and governance. The remaining set of AiBs atoms are held in an AiB multisig and vest continuously for 22 months starting 2 months after genesis.\n\nICF received 10% of the total genesis ATOM allocation to support its mandate of R&D for open and decentralized networks, with particular focus on the Cosmos Network and the Cosmos Project in general. This is a total of 23,619,895.81 ATOMs. ICF ATOMs are split into three sets - all are unrestricted and not subject to avesting scheme. The first set is for advisors and early contributors to organizing the fundraiser and foundation structure, a total of 3,054,207.32 ATOMs allocated to 8 addresses. The second set is for the so-called Game-of-Stakes participants, according to the scoring criteria set out by AiB. This is a total of 288,500 ATOMs allocated to 53 addresses. The final set of ICF atoms are held in an ICF multisig. This is a total of 20,277,188.49 ATOMs split between two distinct multisig addresses controlled by the ICF.\n\nIn total, 236,198,958.12 ATOMs were allocated at genesis to 984 accounts.\n\nInitially, 7% of atoms will be inflated every year and distributed back to the bonded and active atom holders (validators and delegators) for their work validating and securing the ledger. This value will adjust over time to incentivize at least 2/3 of the atoms to be bonded.\n\nToken transfers were not be enabled during this first phase of mainnet launch. Once mainnet was deemed sufficiently stable, bonded Atom holders voted to decide whether or not ATOM transfers should be enabled. This procedure happened through on-chain governance.
